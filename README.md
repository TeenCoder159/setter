# Welcome to the repository of setter

Setter is a project of mine to help me read and write configuration files for my other project, lion AKA lion-cli

Setter can be used in various different places as many projects require a config file for saving things like workspace settings, project settings, currently open files and etc.

Setter is a new project and will be available on crates.io once it is ready
